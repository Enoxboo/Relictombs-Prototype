This is a beginner project made with Godot.
The idea is to create a rogue-like with a "tag assist" system, where you control a quad-element mage exploring dungeons.

For now, graphics are very minimalistic (simple hand-drawn geometric shapes) since the focus is on coding and gameplay.

🎮 Controls

A / D → Move left / right

Shift → Dash

Space → Jump

Right Click → Attack

Q / E → Switch element

T → Reset element

⚠️ Note

This is my first game project, coded without tutorials or AI guidance.
Some parts may be rough or inefficient, but I’ll keep improving and pushing updates as I learn.

📌 Goal

Learn Godot and game development basics.

Experiment with combat, elements, and dungeon progression.
